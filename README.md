# Aging Mouse Colon ScRNA-seq Analysis
This is a single-cell RNA seq analysis workflow using a dataset of epithelial cells from the mouse colon (can be found in the GEO repository with accession numbers GSE168448). 
The objective of this analysis is to find genes which is differentially expressed in aging colon compared to a young colon.
